It’s “-a-lago.” As in the winter White House, Mar-a-Lago.</p>

It's the ab crack. Picture every swimsuit model you can, or Bella Hadid and Jasmine Tookes. Do they have a line going down their abs? That's an ab crack.</p>

The first stand opened on campus of the online retailer and cloud computing giant in December 2015, and it was joined by another in October 2016. More than 1.7 million bananas have been given away by the “banistas” who run the two stands, Monday through Friday.</p>

The top mukbang earners can earn as much as $10,000 a month by some accounts, not including sponsorships. The oddest part of their payment structure is that it’s not pay-per-view, ad-based, or salary-based. Rather, ordinary viewers voluntarily send their favorite BJs (which stands for Broadcasting Jockey, a uniquely Korean use of this acronym) money in the form of “star balloons”—a type of proprietary virtual currency that can be bought and sold with regular fiat cash.</p>

These farms or CAFOs (concentrated animal-feeding operations) can best be described as ‘huge lagoons of pig sewage’. These farms do great environmental harm, and the pigs there endure short, miserable lives.</p>

It’s also a track centred on climate change, and the pair think they invented a new word in the process of writing it: “climaphobe.” “Is it a word?” Anthony asks. Josephine is straight on to Google.

I’ve also seen it used to refer to moves that are tedious, uninspired, or oppressively safe. There seems to be a tinge of old-man nostalgia to this attitude: Sure, the kids these days can beat us, but where’s their sense of style?</p>

Blackface minstrelsy is a theatrical tradition dating back to the early 19th century, in which performers “blacken” themselves up with costume and behaviors to act as black caricatures. The performances put society’s most racist sensibilities on display and in turn fed them back to audiences to intensify these feelings and disperse them across culture. Many of our most beloved entertainment genres owe at least part of themselves to the minstrel stage, including vaudeville, film, and cartoons. While often associated with Jim Crow–era racism, the tenets of minstrel performance remain alive today in television, movies, music and, in its most advanced iteration, on the Internet.</p>

But she turned to political Twitter and to writing research-driven criticism for Jacobin and other publications, working for the Democratic Socialists of America as secretary for a time. An empty room opened in her Bed-Stuy apartment, and Felix Biederman, who went on to cofound Chapo Trap House, moved in. Frost became a regular podcast guest. In a tweet, she coined the moniker “Dirtbag Left” to describe her crew, a piquant alternative to James Wolcott’s.</p>

This year, we cemented a new genre: the docbuster, which regales audiences with brave tales of real-life modern men. Docbusters first bleeped on the radar when Lone Survivor and American Sniper were shock hits. This year, we had four: Sully, 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day, two of which reteamed Lone Survivor star Mark Wahlberg with Lone Survivor director Peter Berg, and all of which took recent-ish headlines and simplified them, and their idealized saviors, into a satisfying adventure where the good guys win—or, at least, make it clear who’s to blame. Docbusters are strangely soothing bedtime stories that whisper yes, the world is cruel and dangerous, but everything’s going to be OK if a competent white man is in charge. </p><p></p><p>(Amy Nicholson)</p>

Not anymore: Between new shops, expansions, and menu upgrades, 2017 is set to be the breakout year for edible cookie dough. Dō — based in New York City, where there is a line for everything — certainly garnered a lot of publicity during its January opening, but it wasn’t the only doughy debut of the year. In February, Tart Sweets bakery in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, started selling its dough in “doughwiches” and by the scoop through its cookie dough bar, which is only open Fridays and Saturdays. Earlier this year, Yoyo Berri frozen yogurt shops in Nebraska and South Dakota started offering raw cookie dough to liven up yesterday’s snack craze. And four flavors of the stuff, served with a side of “ice milk,” will be among the newest items featured at this year’s Minnesota State Fair.</p>

And all these stories raise the question: Is it possible to be a committed feminist and a committed capitalist at the same time? And why are we still so surprised when these women — who have built brands on saying the things we want to hear — turn out to be just as flawed as their male peers?</p>

A finsta is usually a private Instagram account.  While a teen’s primary account might also be private, a finsta is for close friends only.  Only your BFF’s, your baes.

Chances are you have a few in your community: acres of paved parking with weeds creeping through the cracks and a dilapidated big-box structure standing in the middle. They’re the increasingly hard-to-ignore manifestation of what’s often described as the retail meltdown. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the retail sector lost approximately 30,000 jobs in March alone, with thousands of store closings projected through 2017. At this pace, store closings in 2017 are likely to surpass the Great Recession year of 2008.</p>

But the changing perspectives millennials and generation Z-ers have toward food and shopping are pushing more supermarkets to make their stores feel more like experiential food destinations than mere shopping markets. Analysts like Lempert predict that these “grocerants” will become the new standard for grocery stores in the more health-conscience future.</p>

During his speech, Fuller touched on queer representation on the small screen, and how it’s changed in the course of his career. Where his current TV show recently featured a bold and erotic gay sex scene, Fuller reminded his audience of all the “het-washing,” i.e., when a homosexual character is written to be heterosexual, that had occurred on other series. The writer-producer, who is an out gay man, alluded to a Heroes season-one cast member who threatened to walk from the show if his character were revealed to be homosexual. Fuller said that despite the fact the actor was gay, he didn’t want to play a gay character.</p><p></p>

Occasionally, you’ll find a Sopranos or a Cheers or a Mary Tyler Moore Show that arrives fully-formed at the peak of its powers, but most shows are evolving organisms, where the creators need a while to figure out how to best tell their stories, use their actors, work within constraints of budget or schedule or network, etc. Patience is required to see which shows live up to their full potential and which never get there; sometimes you get a Parks and Recreation (which went from mediocre to great after its first season) or an Americans (which went from good to great during that same second year transition), but other times, you might spend a season-plus waiting for a sitcom like Up All Night to stop being somehow less than the sum of its talented parts, only for it to be canceled before that happens.</p><p></p><p>My wife dubbed the practice “hope-watching,” and I’ve done plenty of it over the years as both amateur couch potato and professional.</p>

Pass it on.</p><p></p><p>#this is a good post #also I need an example of hopepunk #bc the name #resonates with me #and I need it #please #if you don’t mind (via @lavender-starling)</p><p></p><p>So the essence of grimdark is that everyone’s inherently sort of a bad person and does bad things, and that’s awful and disheartening and cynical. It’s looking at human nature and going, “The glass is half empty.”</p><p></p><p>Hopepunk says, “No, I don’t accept that. Go fuck yourself: The glass is half-full.”  YEAH, we’re all a messy mix of good and bad, flaws and virtues. We’ve all been mean and petty and cruel, but (and here’s the important part) we’ve also been soft and forgiving and KIND. Hopepunk says that kindness and softness doesn’t equal weakness, and that in this world of brutal cynicism and nihilism, being kind is a political act. An act of rebellion. </p>

In a desperate attempt to nudge users towards conversions like newsletter signups some websites are adding manipulative link text to their popup modals.  These user-shaming labels are called manipulinks (a clever term coined by Steve Costello): they employ the practice of what is often referred to as confirmshaming — making users feel bad for opting out of an offer (logically, this practice might better be described as declineshaming). </p>

It's also known as Tumblr Pink or Rose Quartz. We were warned to expect it in fall 2015, when Pantone decreed it to be one of the colors of the year for 2016.</p><p></p><p>And Pantone's color forecasters looked like geniuses when it broke out big. According to color forecasters, this pink was the right hue at the right time: the muted tone reflects "society's understanding of femininity ... changing the way people think about the female experience."</p><p></p><p>As a result of its timeliness, millennial pink is the icy hue that refuses to go away in 2017 -- it's selling bigger than anything in green, which was supposed to be the It Color for 2017, a sort of "Well, that was a crazy year! Aren't we all glad we're chill and into saving the environment now?" palate cleanser after society had finished wrestling with questions of how we define gender.</p>

Just as soon as I think I have an answer, some new trend materializes that subverts all previous theories. Take, for example, mukbang, a uniquely Korean trend of people getting paid to eat large meals in front of a webcam for a live-streaming broadcast. Wow, the future really is now.</p><p></p><p>Mukbang is a portmanteau word that combines the Korean word for “eat” (muok-da) with the word for “broadcast” (bang song). The top mukbang earners can earn as much as $10,000 a month by some accounts, not including sponsorships. The oddest part of their payment structure is that it’s not pay-per-view, ad-based, or salary-based. Rather, ordinary viewers voluntarily send their favorite BJs (which stands for Broadcasting Jockey, a uniquely Korean use of this acronym) money in the form of “star balloons”—a type of proprietary virtual currency that can be bought and sold with regular fiat cash.</p>

The world is a good place, people are essentially good. The codes of chivalry are in full effect. People in positions of authority are there because they are wise, prudent, caring leaders. They rule because they deserve to rule. They protect the weak, they uphold their ideals, there’s people practicing chaste courtly love in every bower and garden. Things are fine, and people have adventures in which they triumph because (see: all of the above).</p>

So it’s not a leavening agent and it won’t froth when it hits liquid. And because it is not derived from animal or wheat products, it’s considered vegan and it’s also gluten-free. You’ll find it in both powder and flake forms, in bulk bins of health food stores and in shaker bottles. And as for the less-than-fun name, the vegan blogosphere has taken care of that by nicknaming the stuff  “nooch.”</p>

And that's before you can even think about house-training.</p><p></p><p>As it turns out, some companies sympathise with this transition and offer what's known as "pawternity leave."

Victims' ** own viewpoints, desires, and opinions may fade as they are overwhelmed by the abusers'. Over time, they may lose a sense that they even have a right to their own perspectives. This is called perspecticide—the abuse-related incapacity to know what you know (Stark, 2007). Perspecticide is often part of a strategy of coercive control that may include manipulation, stalking, and physical abuse:</p>

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has equated this increase in injuries to a global influx of “petextrians” – pedestrians who simultaneously walk and text. This, combined with the rise of distracted driving due to smartphones, created a massive new safety problem for drivers and pedestrians alike.</p>

The food, I opined to my wife, was premium mediocre. She instantly got what I meant, though she didn’t quite agree that Veggie Grill qualified. In the weeks that followed, premium mediocre turned into a term of art for us, and we gleefully went around labeling various things with the term, sometimes disagreeing, but mostly agreeing. And it wasn’t just us. When I tried the term on my Facebook wall, and on Twitter, again everybody instantly got the idea, and into the spirit of the labeling game.</p>

That's the slang term Miamians created to divide themselves from a certain type of Latin American newcomer who hasn't quite gotten the hang of American life yet. Even minority groups that have been traditionally oppressed and segregated in America manage to find ways to oppress and segregate amongst their own. I'm going to launch that sentence into space as a warning for any incoming armadas of aliens looking to make friends.</p>

It includes, not just removing or sabotaging condoms, but a wide array of tactics intended to sabotage birth control or render it unavailable. "Reproductive coercion" cases are hard to take to court—either because the laws don't exist, or because the cases are difficult to prove—but it's still regarded as unambiguously abusive. It's also common: In 2010, the National Domestic Violence Hotline surveyed 3,169 women, and found that a quarter of them had been ordered not to use birth control. In another survey, 16 percent of women reported that their partners "poked holes in condoms, hid birth-control pills, or threatened them if the women didn't get pregnant."</p>

It’s an elevated life form, one that common folk could never understand. But still not hurting anyone…okay, well at least not without their consent. So what’s the problem?</p>

What does it mean, you ask?! Well since there is no exact translation into English, it means, ‘call someone on his or her cellphone, let it ring 1-3 times, and then hang up.’ This will let your friend know that you have arrived at your previously agreed upon destination.</p>

The latest instance: "stealthing," a practice in which men remove their condoms during sex without their partner's consent. It's drawn plenty of overheated coverage already: The New York Post dubs it "The New Dangerous Sex Trend;" it's a "Disturbing Sex Trend" as per USA Today. You would hardly know from these headlines what the fuss is about: National Women's Law Center fellow Alexandra Brodsky's recent paper in the Columbia Journal of Law and Gender advocates for criminalizing "stealthing" as a form of sexual assault.</p>

The pair featured in all but one of these pictures is the pair of sunglasses I have been looking for since my Entirely Cliche Holly Golightly Obsession at 14, and they can be had on Amazon for just $9.99!

Threatcasting is also a descendent of scenario planning, a tool that allows organizations to image a range of possible and probable futures based upon overlapping forces or trends. Imagine you’re a car company that envisions the possible futures of gas prices and the unemployment rate. If gas prices rise and unemployment falls, what might your sales look like? But what if both gas prices and unemployment rise? From these basic components, you can develop specific scenarios for your company and plan for them.</p>

Like the best marketing terms, “vanlife” is both highly specific and expansive. It’s a one-word life-style signifier that has come to evoke a number of contemporary trends: a renewed interest in the American road trip, a culture of hippie-inflected outdoorsiness, and a life free from the tyranny of a nine-to-five office job.</p>

So why is the local Republican party tearing itself apart — and who’s responsible?</p>

Also, just because the terms are derivatives of each other, doesn’t mean they are the same thing. Wypipo are different from White People.</p><p></p><p>Do tell. How so? Well, first of all, Wypipo say shit like “do tell,” whereas there are a number of white people who would never utter that phrase.

<p class="body" id="commentword--735797"><a href="https://www.good.is/articles/generation-xennials" rel="nofollow">https://www.good.is/articles/generation-xennials</a></p><p></p><p>Between Generation X and the Millennials, there’s a group of people currently in their late 20s and early 30s who don’t identify with either label. We call them the Xennials—a micro-generation that serves as a bridge between the disaffection of Gen X and the blithe optimism of Millennials. But why aren’t they as pissed off as Gen X or as confident as Millennials? Are they luckier than both the preceding and following generations? Or did they get screwed that much harder, thanks to a unique combination of developmental milestones and world events? Our authors, born on either end of the four-year-window, disagree.</p>

<p class="body" id="commentword--751277"><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/xicano/" rel="nofollow">https://www.dailydot.com/irl/xicano/</a></p><p></p><p>The transition of the spelling from Chicano to Xicanx(a/o), which is by no means total, is in large part due to the rise of Chicana Feminism, also known as Xicanisma. Ana Castillo, a pioneer author in the field, coined the term using an ”X” at the beginning instead of “Ch” as a means to more directly identify with the indigenous etymology of the term. Her works, along with many other Xicana authors, pushed the Xicano conversation into deeper consideration about the economic and cultural oppression of Latina women (who are still the most underpaid demographic in the United States) even within the Chicano Movement itself.</p><p></p><p>As Xicanista intellectuals incorporated queer and gender theory, the second “x” was used to be more inclusive of non-binary Xicanxs, as has occurred with the term Latinx. All these new considerations have transformed Chicanismo into a new Xicanismo.</p>
