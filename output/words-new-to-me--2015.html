She wants to revolutionize the fur trade by making roadkill (which she calls “accidental fur”) a viable sector of the market.</p>

It has become standard issue for an entertainer on the comedown from a high-intensity career: Stephen Colbert donned a seaworthy achievement beard during the nine-month hiatus between his first show and his new post in Letterman’s stead, and Jon Stewart has been growing one since stepping down from “The Daily Show,” in August. </p>

With the support of the Finnish Cultural Institute in New York, we have spent the past few months designing and fabricating a smog-tasting cart, complete with built-in smog chamber, as well as developing a range of synthetic smog recipes.</p>

When whipped, this substance takes on an uncannily egg-white-like texture. Coined aquafaba, or Latin-ish for bean liquid, by vegan baker Goose Wohlt, it’s attracted more than 11,000 members to the Facebook group “Vegan Meringue - Hits and Misses!” I’ve been hooked on this Facebook feed for the past two weeks, amazed by all the miraculous things other vegans done with the chickpea-based foam, like bake beautiful cakes and create delicious looking pasta.</p>

Nowhere. That's because arsenalists and "tactical" fetishists do not respect the rest of us. And the gun hustler industry thrives on this disrespect. This isn't about defense; it's about dominance. And people like your reader have done absolutely nothing to clean up the culture they perpetuate.</p>

<p id="commentword--607489"><a href="http://www.refinery29.com/babycore" rel="nofollow">http://www.refinery29.com/babycore</a><br/>To address this, artist Matt Starr came up with what he believes is the "next step in our generation’s obsession with nostalgia:" babycore. "The same way normcore stresses the normal, babycore stresses childishness; this sort of bright, primary-colored, carefree sense of style," he says.</p>

Earlier this year, Slate published a story on Rick and Michael Mast, detailing complaints by the craft chocolate community about their undeserved media attention and unparalleled hubris. (“I can affirm that we make the best chocolate in the world,” Rick told Vanity Fair in February.)</p>

Now, however, the pressure to innovate has become so intense that what were once considered exotic additions to cocktails are barely worth a shrug. We are no longer moved by rare amari, syrah syrups, and sipping vinegars. So it's no surprise that beer has been elevated from a mere sidekick to a novel cocktail ingredient, giving us the beertail. (There's even an entire book dedicated to them—Cocktails on Tap by Portland cocktail dude Jacob Grier.)<br rel="nofollow"/></p>

<p id="commentword--613651">In fact, it is the opposite behavior—the belief that you can do anything, including things you are blatantly not qualified for or straight up lying about—should be pathologized. It has many names (Dunning-Krueger, illusory superiority), but I suggest we call it blowhard syndrome as a neat parallel.<br/><a href="http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/post/110549967516/stop-blowhard-syndrome" rel="nofollow">http://xuhulk.tumblr.com/post/110549967516/stop-blowhard-syndrome</a></p>

Hence the phrase "bomb trains," which was slapped on them by opponents. When these trains move through cities, the risk of potential fatalities increases dramatically.</p>

The researchers hope to legitimize it to accommodate and support the millions of American breastfeeding mothers who bedshare as they better manage their milk supply, get more sleep, strengthen their attachments and validate their roles as mothers, especially if working.</p>

Re/code did some reconnaissance from Apple stores today in Los Angeles and San Francisco and found that many Apple fans in line were there to snag the rose gold version of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. As predicted, the pink phone was a hit with both male and female shoppers. "There’s enough guys getting rose gold that it should be called bros’ gold," said San Francisco Apple store shopper Dan Bentley told Re/Code. "Rose gold or bust," another male shopper said.</p>

They manipulated cards into impossible 3-D configurations at speeds that even to the naked eye resembled camera tricks. They cut, flung, flipped, rotated, juggled, and shuffled playing cards in the middle of the street, along train tracks, their faces emotionless, their hands a blur. It’s yo-yo tricks performed by cardsharps with the street cred of a Parkour video. There’s a name for it: cardistry.</p>

<p id="commentword--647243"><a href="https://reason.com/blog/2015/11/04/chemsex-panic-british-media-alleges-drug" rel="nofollow">https://reason.com/blog/2015/11/04/chemsex-panic-british-media-alleges-drug</a><br/>U.K. media and government officials are sounding the alarm over something called "chemsex," which involves—are you ready for this newfangled idea?—taking mind-altering substances and then having sex. Oblivious that they're describing something that has happened for literally all of time, British officials warn that "taking recreational drugs during sex can lead to a number of potentially harmful side effects including facilitating the spread of common STIs and HIV, but also serious mental health problems, such as anxiety, psychoses and suicidal tendencies."</p>

They insist that being gay is a conscious choice that a person makes. I've challenged choicers in the past to prove it—to put up or shut up—and I'm going to issue that challenge again. </p>

<p id="commentword--615445"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/06/sheryl-sandberg-lean-in-choreplay-sex-chores" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/06/sheryl-sandberg-lean-in-choreplay-sex-chores</a><br/>Leaving the unfortunate coinage of “choreplay”, do we really want to live in a world where men are only cleaning up around the house to get some? In a New York Times op-ed touting the new campaign, Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant tell the story of a woman who asked her husband to do the laundry. They write, “He picked up the basket and asked hopefully, ‘Is this Lean In laundry?’” I understand that the anecdote is meant to be charming, but in a culture where men are already taught to feel entitled to women sexually, I don’t find it cute in the least.</p>

Rowling, your mentions probably get bombarded with them daily. But Rowling, ever the sophisticated writer, had a clapback for the ages when one fan tweeted her about Dumbledore's sexuality, saying he or she just couldn't "see him in that way."

He coined the term "conjoyment" to describe Swiss happiness, which is "more than contentment but less than full on joy." Think of it as a solid state of happiness where there are no peaks, like the majestic Matterhorn, or valleys, like Centovalli.</p>

Babies throw tantrums. MRAs are babies, so they're throwing tantrums. Except they weren't. This entire story came from one blog post on We Hunted The Mammoth, which centered around the anti-Furiosa furor on Return Of Kings, a site so viciously anti-woman even Al Bundy would yell at them to grow the fuck up. But RoK isn't a MRA site -- just some random cootiephobes -- and nowhere on Mammoth does it confuse the two. Every other site, desperate for traffic, did that.</p>

In both cases, it seems that perception has swerved far past and missed reality.</p>

A cuckservative is, therefore, a race traitor.</p>

Instead, they're trying to change the way the fashion industry (and the rest of the world) sees them, with the term "curve" — which describes the shape of their body, not just their waistline.<br rel="nofollow"/><br/>The movement recently came into the spotlight after 18-year-old model Jordyn Woods, a newcomer to the modeling scene, was featured in an interview on TeenVogue.com in which she referred to herself as a "curve model" rather than the more common industry term, "plus-size."</p>

While it’s shooting fish in a barrel to mock the simpler times when D-ness was clearly telegraphed via branding, I believe that it’s preferable to the current dilemma of actual douchebags trying to camouflage as nondouchebags. Thanks to irony (and e-commerce!), these days it’s way harder to spot a douchebag.</p>

After observing the guys she found attractive, I came to understand this body type well and was able to identify it. The dad bod is a nice balance between a beer gut and working out. The dad bod says, "I go to the gym occasionally, but I also drink heavily on the weekends and enjoy eating eight slices of pizza at a time." It's not an overweight guy, but it isn't one with washboard abs, either.</p>

A bit of both, probably. A month ago at The Odyssey, Clemson sophomore Mackenzie Pearson explained that this “new trend” had “fraternity boys everywhere” rejoicing. "In case you haven't noticed lately, girls are all about that dad bod," she wrote. "The dad bod is a nice balance between a beer gut and working out. The dad bod says, ‘I go to the gym occasionally, but I also drink heavily on the weekends and enjoy eating eight slices of pizza at a time.’” In the time since, #dadbod has gone viral on social media, to the cheers of Jason Segel lookalikes everywhere.  </p>

The idea was that such highly valued startups were so rare that seeing one was as rare as a unicorn sighting. Now there are herds of unicorns roaming Silicon Valley. At last count, there were 131 in the tech industry. In fact, startups have become so valuable that there are now some that are worth more than $10 billion. These are called "decicorns."</p>

Government by Deal. Government by Waiver. Kludgeocracy. Lawless law... adhocracy," Wallach writes (providing useful links). He argues, however, that these are all just pieces of a larger puzzle: "The deeper and greater problem is — if I can be forgiven for adding yet another label to the already lengthy list —decoherence."<br rel="nofollow"/><br/>Wallach borrows "decoherence" from quantum mechanics, and takes the term to describe the condition where "elements of a system that had been interacting become disconnected from each other, no longer sharing information"</p>

Many are not discovered for weeks or months after their death. In the biohazard cleanup business, these are called “decomps,” and they’re the most laborious jobs. “The best way to describe a decomp clean is peeling layers off an onion,” says Berg. “You just gotta keep pulling back those layers until you don’t find anymore body material.”</p>

In magazine stories and television specials (and in one case, a porn parody of a television special starring Deen himself called Channel 69: Breaking Nudes), they were recast either as hypersexual groupies or innocent victims trapped under his torrid pornographic spell. Nightline drummed up a Deenager exposé in early 2012 that began: “For any parent concerned about what their teen does online, the huge popularity of the young man you are about to meet may be deeply disturbing.” </p>

Asexual. There is the fact that you’ve never felt this way before. So you will go back to that word. You will look it up again and this time you will explore what it means, all its subsets and associated words. In your search you will come across a new word: demisexual.<br/><br/>Someone who can only experience sexual attraction after an emotional bond has been formed. This bond does not have to be romantic in nature.</p>

Firstly, I’m an up-winger, so of course I’m in favor of this ideological revolution. Second, it wouldn’t really be a revolution, but more a reversion to the mean: the up-down distinction has historically been more practically relevant than the left-right distinction. Third, an up-down distinction would redound to the benefit of upwingers. Downwingers are present on both the left and the right, but are more sound than fury—refocusing the debate toward upwinger varieties on the right and the left would further marginalize the opponents of progress.</p>

It all seems to have started with Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan, who in 2004 was featured in a shampoo commercial where he said famously defended his sleek, black hair using the rhythmical-sounding "duang". The word resurfaced again recently after Chan posted it on his Weibo page. Thousands of users then began to flood Chan's Weibo page with comments, coining the word in reference to his infamous shampoo appearance.<br rel="nofollow"/></p>

Efforts to preserve local “character” while accommodating massive development have seen a revival of what’s called “façadism” where old building exteriors are used as a kind of ground-level wrapping on new structures. Facadism is not a new phenomenon, but it’s booming in Seattle these days.</p>

But the market’s maturity is getting tested on Monday, and in the next few weeks, the ramifications of that likely hike are going to play out across the capital markets. The Dow is down more than 200 points, and the S&amp;P 500 is off 25 points at 2074. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose as high as 2.37%, and most markets in Europe and Asia were in the red. The market may yet handle what the folks at Merrill are calling “Fedexodus,” but that isn’t apparent right now.</p>

Unilever’s vice president of skin care, Rob Candelino, told me that before Dove launched a cleansing bar specifically for men in 2010, the company’s research showed that men made up as much as a third of those using the traditional Dove beauty bar. But the original product was strongly associated with women, and as a result the men were using the product in a passive way, often letting their wives or girlfriends buy it, and “probably not telling their guy friends,” Candelino says. The beauty bar’s potential for growth among men was limited so long as it stayed a beauty bar.</p>

<p id="commentword--616111">There’s an idea called “gray man”, in the security business, that I find interesting. They teach people to dress unobtrusively. Chinos instead of combat pants, and if you really need the extra pockets, a better design conceals them. They assume, actually, that the bad guys will shoot all the guys wearing combat pants first, just to be sure. I don’t have that as a concern, but there’s something appealingly “low-drag” about gray man theory: reduced friction with one’s environment. Arc’teryx Veilance had a lot of that in its original DNA, and I also find it, though probably for different reasons, in Outlier. Nothing worse than clothing that gets in its wearer’s way.<br/><a href="http://www.rawrdenim.com/2015/03/william-gibson-interview-buzz-rickson-line-tech-wear-limits-authenticity/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawrdenim.com/2015/03/william-gibson-interview-buzz-rickson-line-tech-wear-limits-authenticity/</a></p>

Though the raw numbers are still quite small, a look at why any sort of jump might be happening is interesting. Larry Gordon, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, thinks the wave of international fascination with Korean pop culture — hallyu — is partially responsible.</p>

In January a woman was caught on video repeatedly driving over an old man who had slipped in the snow.  In April a school bus driver in Shuangcheng was accused of driving over a 5-year-old girl again and again. In May a security camera filmed a truck driver running over a young boy four times; the driver claimed that he had never noticed the child.</p>

It's the idea that winter is a time for big fuzzy blankets, warm sweaters, snuggling, and tasty, hot beverages. Basically if a Pinterest board came to life, it would be the embodiment of koselig.</p>

Though there are still occasional reboots or prequels, this very specific kind of sequel — in which beloved aging stars reprise classic roles and pass the torch to younger successors — is becoming increasingly common in the American film industry. These movies are all about revitalizing old franchises through the notion of legacy, leading to this current wave of what we could call “legacyquels.”</p>

(See the basics below.) Its most visible promoter has been Goofy, leader of the WaffleNYC crew, who turned litefeet into “It’s Showtime!” on the subway. Joyful to some commuters, irritating to others, it now gets performers arrested. But the creators have moved on: Goofy has been dancing in ads in Europe, and Mr. YouTube runs NYCHA-funded classes, wearing shirts and hats from his four sponsors. This summer, Pharrell and P. Diddy flew Mr. YouTube, Kidd Patt, and SpaceMan to L.A. for a video. “In New York,” Kidd Patt says, “people ask what kind of dance I’m doing,” he says. “My goal is to have them be, like, Oh, that’s litefeet!”</p>

Bringing them up front. A screen test. A cowboy ride. A nickel ride.<br/><br/>Police say that intentionally banging a suspect around in the back of a van isn't common practice. But the range of slang terms to describe the practice suggests it's more common that anyone would hope—and a roster of cases show that Freddie Gray is hardly the first person whose serious injuries allegedly occurred while in police transit. Citizens have accused police of using aggressive driving to rough suspects up for decades in jurisdictions across the country. Though experts don't think it's a widespread practice, rough rides have injured many people, frayed relationships, and cost taxpayers, including Baltimore's, millions of dollars in damages.</p>

Whatever the male equivalent of Resting Bitch Face is, Corddry has it: He’s white and power-bald, with a sporty build and small eyes perfect for narrowing into indignant slits or dilating into lecherous orbs, and he favors the kind of bawdy humor he perfected as a correspondent on The Daily Show from 2002 to 2006, where he reported on, among other things, the power of the North Korean Taepodong (try to say it out loud without snickering). </p>

But while the term is new, the idea that technology can insert itself into your sex life like an IRL pop-up ad is probably not unfamiliar to you. Because if it were uncommon, then licensed marriage and family therapist Ian Kerner, PhD wouldn't be so damn successful.</p>

And now there’s a word for that: the eminently logical “pretaliation”. The MP Paul Flynn has been having fun on Twitter by describing Seb Coe’s attempts to defend himself in advance against the report on doping in athletics as “(new word) PRETALIATION”.</p>

A few people wondered if this wasn’t simply hate-watching, though hate-watching to me seems both more active and more actively enjoyable. A few of the answers hinted at specific shows other people have felt this way about: “Broadchurch-ing,” “Card-housing,” and “Friday Night Lights–ing.” My favorite suggestion was “purge-watching,” since it gets at that feeling of dreary obligation, of the chorelike effort to clear away televisual clutter, as though you’re finally eating that can of lentil soup that’s been sitting in the cupboard, just to get rid of it. </p>

The “goodbye to all that” essay has expanded into a less literary form that has come to be known, ironically, as “quit lit.” The term, if not the genre, is currently most prevalent in academia, a field that has recently birthed a spate of “why I quit teaching” essays.</p>

Take “Dear Fat People,” a fat-shaming tirade by YouTuber Nicole Arbour. “Dear Fat People” made so much money that Arbour posted a Snapchat counting 50 dollar bills…but she also lost some of her branded deals and got blacklisted by the tight-knit YouTube community.</p>

The city council is nonpartisan, but a faction emerged that revived an old, slow-growth movement in town, known as the “residentialists.” Their concerns are varied (among them, the perennial suburban concerns of property values and traffic), but their influence has been to block any new development of affordable housing and shoo people like Suzan and James away from Palo Alto. </p>

Bringing them up front. A screen test. A cowboy ride. A nickel ride.<br/><br/>Police say that intentionally banging a suspect around in the back of a van isn't common practice. But the range of slang terms to describe the practice suggests it's more common that anyone would hope—and a roster of cases show that Freddie Gray is hardly the first person whose serious injuries allegedly occurred while in police transit. Citizens have accused police of using aggressive driving to rough suspects up for decades in jurisdictions across the country. Though experts don't think it's a widespread practice, rough rides have injured many people, frayed relationships, and cost taxpayers, including Baltimore's, millions of dollars in damages.</p>

Consider them sadcoms — the raw, honest, surprisingly hopeful, long-gestating progeny of M*A*S*H. Louie was perhaps the genre's modern groundbreaker, showing a person with often-reprehensible morals trying and failing to work against them, for the sake of the many good people around him and a next generation he clearly cares a great deal about. It was shocking, difficult, and heartbreaking, and its honesty resounded deeply with its audience.</p>

According to research, up to 5 percent of children have school refusal, which can occur at any age, but is more common at ages 5, 6, 10 and 11. School refusal is not a formal psychiatric diagnosis, but often associated with mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, which prompts these children to be seen by a psychiatrist.<br/></p>

<p id="commentword--623005"><a href="http://screencrush.com/selective-sequels/" rel="nofollow">http://screencrush.com/selective-sequels/</a><br/>A standard sequel continues all of the ongoing stories from previous films. Return of the Jedi concludes the narrative started by Star Wars and continued by The Empire Strikes Back. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home focuses primarily on a time-traveling adventure, but it also explores the fallout of Spock’s death and resurrection in the previous two films, The Wrath of Khan and The Search For Spock. In contrast, a selective sequel picks and chooses which parts of previous continuity to use and which to discard as if they never happened.</p>

Every week, he hands out check marks denoting an advantage in offense, defense, special teams and intangibles. And every week, he picks Washington to win, while giving the Redskins the edge in intangibles.<br/><br/>Whether it started this way or not, the segment is now delivered with a bit of a wink, if I’m being honest. That wink became something grander in recent days, when the intangibles category was renamed “Skintangibles,” immediately becoming my choice for favorite new word of the year. And yes, Washington still has the edge.</p>

They will eschew the planes, the trains, and the automobiles that make up Turkey Day’s hors d’oeuvres. They will opt, instead, for “Skypesgiving.” The Kernel reports that 14.1 million people used Skype to connect with loved ones on Thanksgiving in 2013, and that number has probably only increased since.</p>

I meet her at the group’s headquarters in hippie-ish Berkeley, Calif. She has a glint of Anne Hathaway looks about her and is nerdy, sure, but also warm, chatty. As Galef would say, I have erred, falling prey to what she calls the Straw Vulcan, the fallacy that rational people are unemotional people. In her words, it’s time to update.</p>

"Far from feeling stigmatized, they welcome the gay gaze, staring invitingly and modeling shirtless on the covers of such gay magazines as Out and The Advocate, or both."

Sweat-shaming is when someone points out your sweatiness as a way to signal disapproval. Like its counterparts, slut-shaming and fat-shaming, sweat-shaming is aimed mainly at women, who are actually not supposed to sweat at all.</p>

Firstly, I’m an up-winger, so of course I’m in favor of this ideological revolution. Second, it wouldn’t really be a revolution, but more a reversion to the mean: the up-down distinction has historically been more practically relevant than the left-right distinction. Third, an up-down distinction would redound to the benefit of upwingers. Downwingers are present on both the left and the right, but are more sound than fury—refocusing the debate toward upwinger varieties on the right and the left would further marginalize the opponents of progress.</p>

Avery Keese, 23, who works at a nonprofit in Virginia, had never heard of cuffing season, but when one of her co-workers brought it up, she recognized the concept immediately. In college, she and her friends often joked about how girls seemed to get “wifeyed up” midway through the fall semester. And as one of her friends pointed out one day, Ms. Keese wasn’t immune to this trend.</p>

She’s sharp, smart and gorgeous, and she’s flighty in a way that makes Evan (Lou Taylor Pucci) want to give chase past the one-night fireworks she offers.  Part of her flirtatious dismissal of commitment is caused by a fear of intimacy, but the main part is caused by her fear of turning into a multi-headed wolftopus mermaid monster in front of a guy she’s crushing on. In order to stay safe (and keep a large amount of others safe), she eschews the possibility of partnership, and when that no longer works, she hides this fundamental thing about herself, allowing herself to feel happy with another for the first time in centuries.</p>

Young Urban Creatives. In a nutshell, a slice of Generation Y, borne of suburban comfort, indoctrinated with the transcendent power of education, and infected by the conviction that not only do we deserve to pursue our dreams; we should profit from them.</p>
