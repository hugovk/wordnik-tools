In what appears to be only the second study of its kind, US research from 2017 found that approximately 6% of students aged 12 to 17 had sent themselves anonymous hate, with boys more likely to engage in the behaviour than girls and LGBT students nearly three times more likely to self-cyberbully. But it's not just the stats that are concerning, but the messages themselves. </p>

It’s not cockiness, it’s not a power trip — it’s the opposite: a healthy, satisfied, low-key way you feel yourself. Some may call this “oh he/she fucks” vibe, but that is different: you can fuck, but not have BDE. Some may call this “well-adjusted,” but we know the truth.</p>

You have guys like rapper 6ix9ine popularizing “blick,” which is derogatory slang for dark-skinned people. You have white rap influencers encouraging white people to say the N-word on air. You have white vloggers who don’t have all of their facts in place reviewing rap with authority. Take the fight where it counts and leave all these talented black and brown folks be.</p>

It became a shorthand for the notion that a surge of blue would wash over the national political landscape: a widespread repudiation of the current political regime that would be, depending on your point of view, either made inevitable or made to collide vainly against the stubborn solidity of a Republican “red wall.”</p>

After her tweet went viral, Martinez called for a national “bracott.” On April 16, female students across the country clipped their bras to their backpacks instead of wearing them, and male students wore Band-Aids in an “X” shape on their shirts.</p>

Even the idea isn’t new—perhaps you’ve assembled one yourself, in a flash of insight, at some point along the line. But it took an influencer of Timberlake’s stature to focus the public’s attention on what should have been obvious all along: Raspberries and blueberries were made for each other.</p>

What the coffee shop is selling is CBD-infused lattes; CBD, which stands for cannabidiol, is a non-psychoactive compound found in the cannabis plant. Out of curiosity, I bought one. It cost $9 and tasted like a latte with that hint of marijuana herbiness you get from a weed cookie. Google research informed me I would not get high but would be calmer, less anxious, maybe a little sleepy. I have no idea if I felt anything at all. Mostly, I felt like I just spent $9 on coffee.</p>

These incels post obsessively about so-called “Chads,” meaning sexually successful and attractive men, and “Stacys,” attractive, promiscuous women who sleep with the Chads. Both are positioned as unattainable: The Chad is the masculine ideal, one incel men cannot emulate for reasons of poor genetics, while the Stacy is whom every incel man wants to sleep with but cannot because they aren’t a Chad.</p>

But it’s 7:30 p.m., and simple is the only word my brain can process. This is the moment when I make what I call a cromlet. Imagine the love child of a crepe and an omelet. It’s a riff on the traditional chickpea-flour pancake known as socca, popular in Nice, France. Chickpea flour is a little nutty, packed with plant protein, and makes killer pancakes.</p>

In 2016, Helena, Montana, high school student Kaitlyn Juvik was chastised by administrators for going braless, and she too organized protests (in that case, 300 of her female classmates came to school braless). And last October, Annie Concannon of Cincinnati, Ohio, was “dress-coded” for wearing a crop top. Concannon had paired the shirt with high-waisted jeans and wasn’t exposing her midriff.</p>

Hundreds of thousands of people work in this field, ceaselessly staring at beheadings, scenes of rape and animal torture, and other scarring images in order to filter what appears in our social media feeds.</p>

Naturally, with the bitter cold come the colds. For the next few months, at least 5 of your coworkers and 2 of your close friends will be sniffling and coughing during the morning meeting or weekly happy hour. Much as you enjoy their company, you don’t want their sickness. Whenever I’m feeling under the weather, I dip into my fire cider stash. An apple cider vinegar-based tincture of sorts like oxymel (a mixture of honey and acid, sometimes herbs), fire cider is packed with alliums, peppers, citrus, and herbs and left to ferment for weeks. Oxymel and related mixtures like fire cider have been used as herbal remedies for centuries, soothing coughs and congestion. As you can imagine, the heat in fire cider packs a wallop, and the brew will knock a bug out of your system with ferocity—or at least that's how it feels. Just know that while there’s nothing wrong with sipping on fire cider to soothe your symptoms, if you have a fever, terrible cough, or any other flu-like symptoms you should still see a doctor.</p>

James Gunn offered to donate $100,000 to “Trump’s favorite charity” if the president would publicly step on a scale. Mostly, it was just a lot of pictures of Trump compared to pictures of tall dudes in very good shape.</p>

Rodger’s online history indicated he may have identified himself as an “incel,” or an involuntary celibate, and of the anti-feminist “manosphere.”</p>

And to be a fan of a Who is to participate in a special kind of fandom: You can feel closer than ever to your idol thanks to social media and feel extra-special for connecting with someone nobody else seems to be recognizing. Loving Wholebrities is like being part of an exclusive club.</p>

They prioritize empathy, understanding, and togetherness which is typically, but not always, contrasted by some edge. Perhaps it’s the impermanence of life, the loneliness of small towns, or a nuanced take on mental health, through a broadly comedic lense Nicecore attempts to be a salve for right here, right now.</p>

Proponents claim that raw water’s health benefits include naturally occurring minerals and microbes. But the reality for any inadequately treated water from the tap or a spring is that those minerals can sometimes include arsenic, and those microbes can be deadly.</p>

In 2016, more than a quarter of young adult and children’s books featured characters of color, compared to just 10 percent in 2013. There’s a catch, though. Most of the authors are white. As a sensitivity reader, Clayton’s job is to help nonblack authors avoid portraying black characters in a way that feels inauthentic or uninformed. She herself relies on sensitivity readers to improve her writing — for her first book, she hired 12 different readers to review aspects of the story that she and her writing partner didn’t base on firsthand experience.</p>

Brown likes to work two shifts delivering groceries for Amazon, from 4:30 to 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 to 8:30 a.m., but the morning we talked, no 4:30 shifts were available. He sometimes wakes up at 3 a.m. and does what Flex workers call the “sip and tap,” sitting at home and drinking coffee while refreshing the app, hoping new blocks come up. He does not get paid for the hour he spends tapping.</p>

Jones, which is now in popular use throughout York.</p>

These incels post obsessively about so-called “Chads,” meaning sexually successful and attractive men, and “Stacys,” attractive, promiscuous women who sleep with the Chads. Both are positioned as unattainable: The Chad is the masculine ideal, one incel men cannot emulate for reasons of poor genetics, while the Stacy is whom every incel man wants to sleep with but cannot because they aren’t a Chad.</p>

They’d learned it toward the end of the first trimester through a fairly routine test and had instinctually sent an email to close friends and family with the news. They didn’t particularly care what the baby’s sex was but also didn’t feel that it needed to be kept a secret. Then, just a few days later, an article showed up in McCullough’s Facebook feed about a Canadian baby who had been issued a health card without a gender designation — perhaps the first instance in the world of a government entity not assigning a gender at birth. For McCullough, this was a revelation. “Definitely the concept of not enforcing gender stereotypes was something that was on our radar, but we simply didn’t know or have the idea on our own to not assign the baby a gender,” he says. He began scouring the internet, looking for more information, for other families who might have made the same choice, for guidelines as to how one might go about it. He found a Facebook group and asked to join. Soon he was privy to the names and photos and thoughts and conversations of a small but hard-core group of families who were raising theybies — babies whose parents had decided not to reveal their sex, who used they/them pronouns for their children, and whose goal was to create an early childhood free of gendered ideas of how a child should dress, act, play, and be.</p>

Blac Chyna. Colton Haynes. Zendaya. Bella Thorne. A Wholebrity (or just a “Who”) is the kind of celebrity — or “celebrity” — whose name makes many of us stop and ask: “Who?” The average celebrity-gossip connoisseur might have a difficult time matching a Wholebrity’s name to a face. But to ignore Whos, or pretend to be above them, is to miss out on the cultural conversation of the moment: We are living, increasingly, in a Who universe.</p>

Immediately, you know in your heart who’s not a zaddy. It’s an instinctual response that’s not worth explaining in depth because you’re supposed to just feel it. The subject is not merely conventionally “hot”—he’s a zaddy*. In other words, there’s an inner zaddiness. (The Rock is nice and built, but not a zaddy in my eyes. Neither is Nicholas Cage.) If you don’t like the idea of “daddy,” let alone “zaddy,” well, I feel you, but you don’t have to support the idea of zaddy to recognize one. Here is an incomplete list of famous zaddys, unranked.</p><p></p><p>*Doesn’t have to be an actual father</p>
