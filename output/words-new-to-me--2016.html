Calmer members of the alternative right refer darkly to these people as the “1488ers,” and for all their talk of there being “no enemies to the right,” it’s clear from the many conversations we’ve had with alt-righters that many would rather the 1488ers didn’t exist.</p>

The idea was that they’re like a lightweight foundation with skin-improving qualities (AKA, a tinted moisturizer). Asia is real, real big on skincare. Korea and Japan are known for their 10-step skincare routines (that is, all the face stuff that comes BEFORE even putting makeup on); this 10-step thing has been slightly debunked as most women there don’t actually follow a 10-step routine, but there are a lot more “essential” skin care steps they have outside of our basic cleanse, tone, moisturize process. Since BB creams were so popular, a buncha US lines started marketing them as “beauty balm”.</p>

Since then, hunters have spotted the hybrid creatures in chilly Arctic waters. Apparently, beluga whales and narwhals produce offspring with big, burly heads — but, sadly, no tusks. (We drew one in anyway.)</p><p></p><p>While belwhal is a worthwhile contender, narluga is hard to beat. It captures the distinctive sounds of both animals’ names — the nar- of narwhal and the -luga of beluga — and sounds pretty mellifluous to boot. Try it yourself: Narluuuuuuuuga!</p>

We both visited in the first weeks and were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the space itself and the story that the museum — the Blacksonian, if you will (and, boy, will we!) — tells about the founding and development of this country.</p>

And to the extent that labels are helpful for quickly self-identifying, they don't always exist for the diversity of racial possibilities that mixed Americans increasingly want to see recognized. When it comes to mixed-race in America, Mexican-American author Richard Rodriguez has written, we rely on an "old vocabulary — black, white," but, "we are no longer a black-white nation."</p><p></p><p>This may be why in LA, many young people who are both black and Mexican are turning to a handy word to describe themselves: "Blaxican."</p>

Sure, it’s one of those awful portmanteaus used by marketing types to shift records, but it perfectly describes Hill’s bass heavy, James Blake-esque tunes. She’s signed to Kanye West’s label after serving as a backing dancer for his Yeezus tour, so no pressure.</p>

Hence, CC = coverage, correct. The idea is the same as a BB cream, but they are a heavier formulation.</p>

The recipe starts with Nacho Cheese Doritos, which are then topped with a variety of ingredients: cueritos (pickled pork rinds), small batons of jicama, cubed cucumber, grated carrots, peanuts (most often described by the vendors as japonés, the ones with the crunchy, soy sauce-flavored shell), gummy bears, lime juice, chili powder, salsa Valentina or another hot sauce, and chamoy, an addictive sweet-salty-sour sauce made from pickled fruit. It's outrageous.</p>

They could throw in a bunch of bottom-feeding social media sexists, like the poster in a pro-Sanders Facebook group who called Hillary “clitrash.” The campaign also made its own gendered gaffes, including the smug statement that Bernie was “willing to consider” Hillary for veep. Finally, there’s the tendency of online Sanders supporters to call Clinton fans corporate-shilling “Hillary bots” and to argue that journalists are “auditioning for jobs with the Clinton White House.” Put it all together, and you have a perfectly reasonable (though not unimpeachable, and certainly not universal) argument that Bernie has a little bit of a Bro problem.</p>

The new word, now part of my professional lexicon, is “Creasters.” Like a celebrity mash-up, it is a morphing of two words: “Christmas,” and “Easter.”</p><p></p><p>This word refers to people who attend church on those two annual high holy days, but otherwise stay away. The word may be new, but the concept is not. The previous phrase of choice was “C-&amp;-E Christians.” Creasters (unlike their C-&amp;-E predecessors) are young adults, primarily Gen Xers and younger. So, why is it that people are staying away from institutionalized religion except for twice annually? And, is there anything the traditional Church can do to entice them to return?</p>

She was called a “niglet” and a “dindu.” The alt-right unleashed on my wife, Nancy, claiming that she had slept with black men while I was deployed to Iraq, and that I loved to watch while she had sex with “black bucks.” People sent her pornographic images of black men having sex with white women, with someone photoshopped to look like me, watching.</p>

The recipe starts with Nacho Cheese Doritos, which are then topped with a variety of ingredients: cueritos (pickled pork rinds), small batons of jicama, cubed cucumber, grated carrots, peanuts (most often described by the vendors as japonés, the ones with the crunchy, soy sauce-flavored shell), gummy bears, lime juice, chili powder, salsa Valentina or another hot sauce, and chamoy, an addictive sweet-salty-sour sauce made from pickled fruit. It's outrageous.</p>

Bush so unswervingly that we may as well call those policies—the conventional wisdom or, rather, the conventional folly of early 21st-century American politics—the Dubyobama consensus. Trump’s candidacy, and in some ways that of his Democratic rival Bernard Sanders as well, marks the point at which the blowback from those policies has become a massive political fact. That this blowback isn’t taking the form desired by many people on the leftward end of things is hardly surprising; it was never going to do so, because the things about the Dubyobama consensus that made blowback inevitable are not the things to which the left objects.</p>

Your right hand,” Charney told The World. “In doing that, you automatically swivel your body. And you position your head and shoulders so you are looking directly out. First, past the rearview mirror. And then, you are very easily able to look back and see if there are oncoming bicycles or cars or whatever.”</p>

In other words, “House Hunters” succeeds not just in winning TV-watching homeowners — but also winning homeowner-targeting advertisers, like Home Depot, who know they’re more likely to reach who they need.</p>

For a reported $1,000 per day, patients heal through heli-hiking (“Alcohol and drug rehab takes on a different perspective at 10,000 feet!”) and can take on the largest indoor ropes course “anywhere in the alcohol and drug rehab industry.” As far as I can tell, there have been few randomized trials on the efficacy of heli-hiking for alcoholism. And if you’re choosing an addiction treatment program based on the size of its ropes course, you probably haven’t hit rock bottom.</p>

Mesquite-smoked bacon elevates a humble hot dog from ho hum to mouth watering. The smoky southwest flavor is nestled in a fresh bolillo roll that creates a soft little boat for the dog. Then you load that sucker up with all sorts of toppings to taste, as each hot dog cart has its own special flair. Or stick with the original when the hotdoguero asks, "Con todo?" Pinto beans, tomatoes, onions, and mayo. Why mess with perfection?</p>

Ketchup, mustard and mayo are standard, along with salsa verde and aji, an Ecuadorian hot sauce that's made with red chiles, onion, lime, cilantro and tamarillo (a slightly sweet, tangy fruit native to South America).</p>

It’s easy for me to laugh at these clumsy attempts to make language obey the dictates of political correctness—but I laugh from a position of relative safety, since I am not a WWU professor.</p>

Instead of such a divisive term, we should insert a more approachable and factual word that preserves opportunities for bridge-building and learning: “Islamonausea.” This does not render communication impossible, but enables visitors to our Western cultures to notice aspects of their behavior that make us sick.</p>

Call it the Comedy of Unplanned Pregnancy. The Oops, I had a baby! movie. The momcom. Classic romcoms, and the screwball comedies that came before them, presented love as a battle of the sexes that was also a battle of wits. Men and women sparred verbally until they negotiated a kind of marriage contract they both could agree upon. The audience, meanwhile, got to participate vicariously in this public debate about how a relationship should be. In contemporary momcoms, though, love can only happen by chance. An independent career woman accidentally gets pregnant, which leads to the formation of a couple that would never have formed otherwise.</p>

The holes are then filled with a liquid or filling — like condensed milk, pureed fruit, chocolate cream, or pudding — to infuse extra flavor into every bite. Here are 15 ways to make one.</p>

Touted as the "Raindrop Cake," the confection is basically glorified Jell-O, but that's not stopping the social media masses from freaking out about it. The glass-like dessert has become so popular in Japan that some are saying it has reached Cronut status. And now it's coming to the U.S. by way of New York.</p>

While the ideal is to eat as little meat as possible, even cutting back by a limited amount confers health and environmental benefits. In other words, reducetarians (Kateman and Alterman invented the word) attempt to reduce the overall amount of meat in their diets, but don’t beat themselves up over the occasional T-bone steak or chicken salad sandwich. </p>

The next fissure appears to be generational: The so-called reformicons—a priesthood of intellectual Gen X-ers who have been trying to recalibrate Reagan’s vision for the conditions of the 21st century—are at the very heart of the agonized intraparty conflict. On one hand, they’ve often been seen as the potential ideological future of the party. On the other, a resoundingly loud majority of their electorate, the very people for whom they were tending the flame, have roundly rejected their vision.</p>

The Hartwigs feel that if you’re trying to recreate a pizza made out of cauliflower crust in order to scratch a craving itch, then you’re kind of missing the point. To quote the Whole30 website, “You can tell yourself it’s okay, it’s still pretty good, you’re totally satisfied … but that’s kind of a lie. Because you know exactly how good pants-less sex feels.”</p>

A 2013 study by the American Psychological Association found that more than half of all workers surveyed checked their work messages, including texts, emails, and voicemails, from smartphones or other home devices. A 2014 survey by Gallup found that nearly 80 percent of respondents view the ability to continue working from home in a “strongly positive” or “somewhat positive” light. In fact, this tendency has become so widespread that, by 2014, researchers had coined a new word to describe the stress it causes: telepressure. Whether employees check their email from home is likely to vary depending on the nature of their job. Abedin’s work—that of an elite political professional—is certainly the kind that typically necessitates lots of emailing, at any time, from anywhere.</p>

With the Thanksgiving holiday recently passed, now would be a good time to examine our everyday lives to see if they reflect an attitude of gratefulness to our Creator. Second Timothy 3:2-5 recites a lengthy list of common sins that will characterize mankind in the end times.  We find “ungrateful” (unthankful) in the list.</p>

Even if these impacts are real, then they’re probably good for us.</p>

For example, let's say you and your friends are dancing and one lands a flawless back flip. ('Cause you know; that could totally happen.) That would be your cue to yell out "yeet!" and let them know just how awesome they are.</p>
